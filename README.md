# AoC22

This repository contains the solutions to the 2022 [Advent of Code][1] by Eric Wastl. The solutions are written in python. Data is usually attached to the folders for reproducibility.

This was made as a funny exercise and to refresh some basic coding skills :)

From Day 12, I got quite busy at work and lost the momentum. I will resume with the problems when I have more time
